* My local Portfiles

  This is my collection of local [[https://www.macports.org/][macports]] Portfiles.

  To use them, all you need to do is clone this repository somewhere,
  ~cd~ into it, and run ~portindex~ (assuming you have [[https://www.macports.org/][macports]]
  installed). See [[https://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories][this link]] for more information.
